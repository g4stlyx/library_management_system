# MVC SSR Library Management System

my first C# .NET project, it seems nice enough. includes:

* Argon2 + salting + peppering
* JWT
* Sqlite
* Books, Users, Loans

### TODO

* admins sees everything
* everybody sees every book
* users sees only their loans
* users dont see any user
* user profile
* sanitization and validation for all user inputs (both in frontend-maybe not- and backend)
* searching, filtering, and sorting books, users (for admins), loans (for admins)
* maybe a better frontend using bootstrap etc.

### TODO but a little bit advanced

* password changing
* email validation
* forgot password
* friend functionality. users see their friends loans -ik its not that logical-
* MFA?
* read, reading, to read lists?
